# Pac-Man Algorithm Exploration

This project is an exploration of different simple algorithms for playing Pac-Man. The goal is not optimal play, but rather to test different ideas about how this classic arcade game could be algoritmically played.

If you think this project is at all cool, please fork and write some Pac-Man algorithms!

Pac-Man implementation forked from usawa/pypacman. All credit to them for their implementation of Pac-Man.
